# Upload script

-   videos go into this results folder
-   script needs to be in the same directory as videos
-   videos scheduled to release every 4 hours

# Files needed

-   client_secrets.json

I have left a .template for you to copy

```
{
    "web": {
        "client_id": < your client id goes here >,
        "client_secret": < your client secret goes here >,
        "redirect_uris": [],
        "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
    }
}
```

# Changes required

## I reccomend copying and pasting your first video object in the `videos.json` and make sure the first object has a time, 4 hours before you want your video to go public, and `uploaded = True`.

The script needs at least one `uploaded : true` and `uploaded_at : <time>`. The next item will be set to upload 4 hours later.

-   All objects in videos.json

```
{
    ...,
    "uploaded": false,
    "uploaded_at": "2022-10-20 12:00:00"
}
```

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

you can get the uploaded_at time by running the `first_time.py` script and using the print output.
uploaded : false has been added to the videos.py payload so should be uploaded : false by defualt.

# first_time.py

-   outputs the time for `uploaded_at`. This only needs to be done once.
-   adds `uploaded : false ` to all objects in `videos.json`
